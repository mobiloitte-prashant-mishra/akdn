One of a few examples surviving in major museum collections, it was carved in Sicily or southern Italy, with images derived from Fatimid court culture. The tusk is decorated with a hunting scene comprising real and mythical animals running in file across its length. The exquisite carved decoration on the horn, and the English silver mounts that were added in the seventeenth century, suggest that it may have served a ceremonial role.
